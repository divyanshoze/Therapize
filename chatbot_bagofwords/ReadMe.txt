-Download all the files.
-Keep them in one folder so that you save time on changing directories.
-Since it already has a trained model file. [In case it doesn't work, either it's the libraries or just running intents and preprocess and *not* the train for obvious reasons]
-Run the chat_with_therapize directly, and take care of your mental health :)
